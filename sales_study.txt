SELECT sp.Name,o.id,o.order_date FROM orders as o JOIN salesperson as  sp ON sp.id = o.salesperson_id  AND o.order_date < curdate() - interval 1 year

d. Find the names of the salespeople whose order has the maximum amount as of now(Do this without using MAX Or MIN, do this using joins and consider possibility of more than one person having the highest amount)
SELECT sp.Name,sum(o.amount) as total_order_amount FROM salesperson sp JOIN orders o ON sp.id = o.salesperson_id GROUP BY o.salesperson_id ORDER BY total_order_amount DESC limit 1

f. In the last query, get the total amount of money they have got orders for
SELECT distinct sp.id,sp.name,GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT c.industry),sum(o.amount) FROM salesperson sp JOIN orders o ON sp.id = o.salesperson_id JOIN customer c on c.id = o.cust_id GROUP BY sp.id
